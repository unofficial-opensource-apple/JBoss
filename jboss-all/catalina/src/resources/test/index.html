<h1>Servlet / EJB example</h1>
Congratulations!  You seem to have successfully deployed the example.

<p>This example is a very simple servlet which calls a very simple StatelessSession bean. The bean is deployed twice: once using Non Optimized calls (ie RMI), and once with the inVM optimization, so you can see the difference.</p>

<a href="servlet/HelloEJB">Execute the example</a><br>
<a href="servlet/HelloEJB?trace">Execute the example with tracing</a><br>
<a href="servlet/HelloEJB?speed">Execute the example with speed test</a><br>
<p>For better results in the speed test, I recommend to turn off debug logging: edit your jboss.conf file and find the ConsoleLogging entry: set the first ARG to "Information,Warning,Error".<br>Note that all tomcat logging is seen as "Information".</p>
<p>If you use a hotspot JVM, it will also get much faster after a while (click on "reload")</p>
