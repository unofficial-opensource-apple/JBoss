  <!-- ServiceBindingManager configuration. This is a service that provides
    binding mappings of service (host,port) pairs to allow multiple instances
    of JBoss to be run on a server.

    Typically you will add this configuration to the core jboss-services.xml
    descriptor rather than deploying this as a seperate mbean so that it
    may be available for use by other mbeans during their configuration.

    Note that the JMX object name given below must be used
    as the ServiceConfigurator currently has this hard coded.
